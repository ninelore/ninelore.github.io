In this post I will write about my journey with Linux, what experiences I made and why I switched back to windows recently.
The motif I was tired of Windows crashes and the privacy concerns. Also, Windows brings alot of bloat with it that nobody needs.
Last but not least: Windows is flawed in it&amp;rsquo;s own ways, like the occasionally BSOD&amp;rsquo;s or the slow Windows Update.</description></item><item><title>Arma on Linux</title><link>https://ninelore.github.io/projects/armaonlinux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 21:39:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ninelore.github.io/projects/armaonlinux/</guid><description>Preamble: A few months and improvements to Proton after its first release, i had the first known, good working Arma installation on Linux.
Since Proton 4.11 as good as all tweaks needed to run Arma became obsolete, and it became as easy as never before to play not only Arma and Steam Games, but also non-Steam games because of many Proton improvements being up streamed to Wine. You can check if your Games are working on the Lutris Website, the WineHQ and the ProtonDB Websites.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to ninelore's Blog</title><link>https://ninelore.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 19:37:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ninelore.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Welcome to my new Blog I decided to make this Blog to write about my thoughs, how random they may be.
