This is my personal Blog, and you should treat everything that you read in my blog posts as opinions if not stated otherwise.
Childhood Born in the German State of Hesse, I got my first PC with the age of five, and my first contact with Linux with seven years.
I lived a very rough childhood with, I dare to say, abuse.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to ninelore's Blog</title><link>https://ninelore.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 19:37:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ninelore.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Welcome to my new Blog I decided to make this Blog to write about my thoughs, how random they may be.
