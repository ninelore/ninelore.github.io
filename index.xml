Since Proton 4.11 as good as all tweaks needed to run Arma became obsolete, and it became as easy as never before to play not only Arma and Steam Games, but also non-Steam games because of many Proton improvements being up streamed to Wine. You can check if your games are working on the Lutris website, the WineHQ and the ProtonDB websites.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://9lo.re/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://9lo.re/about/</guid><description> he/him &amp;amp;&amp;amp; they/them maybe autistic, never got it checked probably PTSD, never checked aswell Melodeath and Djent, sometimes other stuff either too much or not enough coffee to be expanded&amp;hellip;</description></item></channel></rss>
