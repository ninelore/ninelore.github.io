As of 2023, the official Arma launcher also works on Linux using Proton.</p><p>This new guide is based on all the knowledge that got collected up until now.

Downloading Arma</h3><p>Do the following before starting to download Arma!</p><p>Go into Steam settings and then click on &ldquo;Steam Play&rdquo;. Check both boxes and choose the newest Proton version available (not Experimental)
<span class="image fit"><img src=/pictures/armalinux/steamplaysettings.png alt></span></p><p>Now go into the Steam game settings menu and add the <code>%command% -nolauncher</code> to the launch options
<span class="image fit"><img src=/pictures/armalinux/armalaunchoptions.png alt></span></p><p>Then go into the &ldquo;Compatibility&rdquo; Tab and set the Proton version again
<span class="image fit"><img src=/pictures/armalinux/armaprotonversion.png alt></span></p><p>Now you can start the downlaod of Arma 3.</p><h3 id=3-starting-and-playing-the-game>3. Starting and playing the Game</h3><p>When the download is finished, start the game once and exit it again after reaching the main menu.</p><p>Now you need a launcher to manage Mods and launch options. I highly recommend using the <a href=https://github.com/muttleyxd/arma3-unix-launcher>Arma 3 Unix Launcher by muttleyxd</a> instead of the official launcher.
Download: <a href=https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arma3-unix-launcher-bin>Arch Linux AUR</a> | <a href=https://github.com/muttleyxd/arma3-unix-launcher/releases/latest>as .deb or .AppImage</a></p><p>This is everything you need to play Arma 3 on Linux without ACRE2 or TFAR. Congratulations to get this far. ;)</p><h3 id=4-the-helper-script-and-acre2--tfar>4. The Helper script and ACRE2 / TFAR</h3><p><strong>Important: Make sure to start Arma at least once into the main menu before moving on!</strong></p><h4 id=41-the-helper-script>4.1 The Helper script</h4><p>The Arma3Helper Script (formerly Arma3TS.sh) is reqired to run ACRE2 or TFAR on Linux. It also provides utility to make some troubleshooting (see Chapter 5) easier.</p><p>Place the <code>Arma3Helper.sh</code> <a href=https://github.com/ninelore/armaonlinux>provided here (click me)</a> in your home directory for easy access.<br>Edit the file and adjust the settings inside the marked area in that file according to the comments.</p><h4 id=42-preperation-for-acre2--tfar>4.2 Preperation for ACRE2 / TFAR</h4><p>The Arma3Helper script provides a wrapper for winetricks that will set the wineprefix to Arma&rsquo;s compatdata folder after you adjusted the settings inside the script.<br>To install a variety of DLLs/features that are required for ACRE2 / TFAR as well as fix alot of common issues, run the following command.<br><code>./Arma3Helper.sh winetricks Arma</code><br>For transparency: The DLLs/features installed are <code>d3dcompiler_43</code>, <code>d3dx10_43</code>, <code>d3dx11_43</code>, <code>mfc140</code> and <code>xact_x64</code>.</p><h4 id=43-acre2--tfar>4.3 ACRE2 / TFAR</h4><p>Download Teamspeak 3 for <strong>Windows x64(!)</strong>.<br>Install Teamspeak into the compatdata directory of Arma by running<br><code>./Arma3Helper.sh install path/to/TS3-Installer.exe</code>.<br><strong>IMPORTANT: In the Teamspeak installer, select &ldquo;Install for all Users&rdquo; and leave the default path!!!</strong></p><p>After the insallation you can start TeamSpeak by just running <code>./Arma3Helper.sh</code> <strong>After you have started Arma</strong>.</p><p>Before joining a TeamSpeak server, disable the &ldquo;Gamepad and Joystick Hotkey Support&rdquo; plugin to prevent it from crashing.</p><p>For TFAR you need to manually copy the plugin dll&rsquo;s folders into your Teamspeak path (<code>c/Program Files/TeamSpeak 3 Client/plugins/</code>). Note that a <code>.ts3plugin</code> file is nothing but a ZIP with a different extension. Just unzip it with the tool of your choice.</p><h3 id=5-troubleshooting>5. Troubleshooting</h3><p>Note: Some troubleshooting steps require the Arma3Helper script. See Chapter 4.1 for more info. Alternatively you can use <a href=https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks>protontricks</a>.</p><h4 id=51-i-have-problems-with-sound-andor-thermal-vision>5.1 I have problems with sound and/or thermal vision</h4><p>See Chapter 4.2</p><h4 id=52-i-still-have-problems-with-sound-only-for-proton-63-and-older>5.2 I still have problems with sound (<strong>only for Proton 6.3 and older!</strong>)</h4><p>You have 2 options to achieve the same fix.<br>You can set the enviromental variable <code>WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xaudio2_7=n"</code> in the Steam startup options (or via the Arma 3 Unix Launcher).<br><span class=image><img src=/pictures/armalinux/armalaunchoptions-xaudio.png alt></span><br>The other way is to set it via <code>./Arma3Helper.sh winecfg</code> and then under &ldquo;Libraries&rdquo;.<br><span class=image><img src=/pictures/armalinux/winecfg-xaudio.png alt></span></p><h4 id=53-arma-doesnt-open-or-crashes-instantly>5.3 Arma doesnt open or crashes instantly</h4><p>Run the following command depending on your linux distro to install possibly missing dependencies<br>Arch Linux based: <code>sudo pacman -S vulkan-tools</code><br>Debian/Ubuntu based: <code>sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-utils</code><br>Fedora: <code>sudo dnf install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools</code></p><h4 id=54-command-x-returns-error-y>5.4 Command X returns error Y</h4><p>Double check for software and driver updates as well as the spelling of the commands and the settings. If you still got errors continue to Chapter 5.99</p><h4 id=599-i-still-have-a-problem>5.99 I still have a problem</h4><p>More help is available on the <a href=https://discord.gg/p28Ra36>ArmaOnUnix Discord</a><br><strong>Important:</strong> Do not open a issue in <a href=https://github.com/ninelore/armaonlinux>ninelore/armaonunix</a> before asking on the Discord!</p><h3 id=6-increasing-performance>6. Increasing Performance</h3><h4 id=61-additional-launch-parameters>6.1 Additional Launch Parameters</h4><p>Try a combination of one or more of the following to see what works for you the best. Set them as desired via the Arma 3 Unix Launcher or add them to the Steam command line.</p><ul><li><code>-noSplash</code> No splash screens. Game startup speedup.</li><li><code>-skipIntro</code> Static Background for main manu. Minor game startup speedup.</li><li><code>-world=empty</code> Load an empty world for main menu background. Significant game startup speedup.</li><li><code>-exThreads=3</code> for 2 CPU cores or <code>-exThreads=7</code> for 4 cores or more; Offloads some work onto different threads. Usually a minor FPS Increase.</li><li><code>-enableHT</code> enables use of logical cores instead of only physical cores. May improve or harm FPS depending of your PC. Try if it works for you. This is overwritten by <code>-cpuCount</code>.</li><li><code>-hugepages</code> Enable huge page size for memory allocation. Try if it works for you.</li><li><code>-noLogs</code> Not having to write logs may increase performance, but be sure to disable this if you need to troubleshoot problems.</li><li><code>-malloc=&lt;string></code> Use a particular Memory Allocator (for advanced users, more info <a href=https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_Custom_Memory_Allocator>here</a>).</li><li><code>-cpuCount=1</code> Reportedly solves some issure for some people but might decrease performance. NOTE: This should be fixed on the arma perf branch and will find its way into the release branch of Arma soon.</li></ul><h4 id=62-general-linux-gaming-optimizations>6.2 General Linux gaming optimizations</h4><p>Note: These Tips aren&rsquo;t exclusive to Arma, but will apply to almost all Linux gaming.</p><ul><li><p>Use a non-standard kernel:</p><ul><li>Arch Linux oficially supports the <code>linux-zen</code> kernel in its repositories</li><li>Debian / Ubuntu users can try the <a href=https://liquorix.net/>Liquorix</a> or <a href=https://xanmod.org/>XanMod</a> kernels</li><li>Advanced users can build a customized kernel for their system with the help of <a href=https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg>linux-tkg</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Use different desktop enviroment or optimize a slow one:</p><ul><li>KDE Plasma users can replace <code>kwin</code> with <code>kwin-lowlatency</code></li><li>You might want to switch to a slimmer desktop enviroment like XFCE, LXQt or a bare window manager setup (advanced users)</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=epilogue>Epilogue</h3><p>This Guide was first released in the <a href="https://armaworld.de/forum/thread/4992-ger-eng-arma-on-linux-ninelore-s-guide-acre-tfar-working/?postID=39909#post39909">Armaworld Forums</a> by me.
