&lt;p>A few months and improvements to Proton after its first release, i had the first known, good working Arma installation on Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since Proton 4.11 as good as all tweaks needed to run Arma became obsolete, and it became as easy as never before to play not only Arma and Steam Games, but also non-Steam games because of many Proton improvements being up streamed to Wine. You can check if your games are working on the Lutris website, the WineHQ and the ProtonDB websites.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
