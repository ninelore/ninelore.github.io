In this post I will write about my journey with Linux, what experiences I made and why I switched back to windows recently.
The motif I was tired of Windows crashes and the privacy concerns. Also, Windows brings alot of bloat with it that nobody needs.
Last but not least: Windows is flawed in it&amp;rsquo;s own ways, like the occasionally BSOD&amp;rsquo;s or the slow Windows Update.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to ninelore's Blog</title><link>https://ninelore.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 19:37:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ninelore.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Welcome to my new Blog I decided to make this Blog to write about my thoughs, how random they may be.
