# Welcome to my new Blog

I decided to make this Blog to write about my thoughs, how random they may be. Possible Topics could be:
- experience i made
- opinions i need to share
- tutorials 
- whatever else could come in my mind

## Why i decided to start a Blog
It was the recent [Post of the Lutris founder Mathieu](http://mathieu.comandon.org/not-on-the-same-page) that ignited an uge inside me that i should share my thoughs. I dont really know what anything else to say besides that.

I hope that you will like my content ;)
