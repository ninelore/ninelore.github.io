<h2 class=major>Arma on Linux</h2>
<span class="image main"><img src alt></span>
<h3 id=preamble>Preamble:</h3>
<p>A few months and improvements to Proton after its first release, i had the first known, good working Arma installation on Linux.</p>
<p>Since Proton 4.11 as good as all tweaks needed to run Arma became obsolete, and it became as easy as never before to play not only Arma and Steam Games, but also non-Steam games because of many Proton improvements being up streamed to Wine. You can check if your Games are working on the Lutris Website, the WineHQ and the ProtonDB Websites.</p>
<p>With the release of Proton 6.3-8, the last major burden, BattleEye, is now working and we can play Arma 3 on Linux without <strong>any</strong> restriction!<br>
The only flaw is the non-working original Launcher, which is no problem due to the excellent work of some amazing people that made amazing 3rd-party launchers.</p>
<p>This new Guide is based on all the knowledge that got collected up until now. This Guide will get continuous Updates</p>
<h3 id=0-disclaimer>0. Disclaimer</h3>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t take any responsibility if any (im)possible damage occurs on your hardware, software or your health, if you lose your job because you were late because your alarm clock didn&rsquo;t ring or if a thermonuclear war breaks out. You are responsible for all changes you are making! Please read everything carefully and if needed twice to prevent misunderstandings. You can contact me via the information provided on my <a href=https://ninelore.github.io>website</a></strong></p>
<h3 id=1-prepare>1. Prepare</h3>
<p>You should have</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic terminal/Bash knowledge</li>
<li>All software and drivers up to date</li>
<li>wine-staging (make sure all dependencies are installed)</li>
<li>For BattleEye: Steam beta client (switch via steam settings)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=2-downloading-arma>2. Downloading Arma</h3>
<p>Do the following before starting to download Arma!</p>
<p>Go into Steam settings and then click on &ldquo;Steam Play&rdquo;. Check both boxes and choose the newest Proton version available (not Experimental)
<span class="image fit">
<img src=/pictures/armalinux/steamplaysettings.png alt>
</span>
</p>
<p>Now go into the Steam game settings menu and add the <code>%command% -nolauncher</code> to the launch options
<span class="image fit">
<img src=/pictures/armalinux/armalaunchoptions.png alt>
</span>
</p>
<p>Then go into the &ldquo;Compatibility&rdquo; Tab and set the Proton Version again
<span class="image fit">
<img src=/pictures/armalinux/armaprotonversion.png alt>
</span>
</p>
<p>Now you can start the downlaod of Arma 3.</p>
<h3 id=3-starting-and-playing-the-game>3. Starting and playing the Game</h3>
<p>When the download is finished, start the game once and exit it again after reaching the main menu.</p>
<p>Now you need a Launcher to manage Mods and launch options. I highly recommend using the <a href=https://github.com/muttleyxd/arma3-unix-launcher>Arma 3 Unix Launcher by muttleyxd</a>.<br>
Download: <a href=https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/arma3-unix-launcher-bin>Arch Linux AUR</a> | <a href=https://github.com/muttleyxd/arma3-unix-launcher/releases/latest>as .deb or .AppImage</a></p>
<p>This is everything you need to play Arma 3 on Linux without ACRE2 or TFAR. Congratulations to get this far. ;)</p>
<h3 id=4-acre2tfar>4. ACRE2/TFAR</h3>
<p>Make sure you did the command of Chapter 5.1 and that you are running Proton 6.3 or newer!</p>
<p>Place the <code>Arma3TS-*.sh</code> <a href=https://github.com/ninelore/armaonlinux>provided here (click me)</a> in your home directory.<br>
Edit the file and adjust the settings inside the marked area in that file according to the comments.<br>
Now download a recent <strong>Windows Installer(!)</strong> of Teamspeak 3.<br>
Install Teamspeak into the compatdata directory of Arma by running <code>./Arma3TS-*.sh install path/to/TS3-Installer.exe</code>.<br>
<strong>IMPORTANT: In the Teamspeak Installer, select &ldquo;Install for all Users&rdquo; and leave the default path!!!</strong></p>
<p>After the Insallation you can start TeamSpeak by just running <code>./Arma3TS-*.sh</code> <strong>After you have started Arma</strong>.</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<h3 id=5-troubleshooting>5. Troubleshooting</h3>
<h4 id=51-i-have-problems-with-sound-andor-thermal-vision>5.1 I have problems with sound and/or thermal vision</h4>
<p>Install <a href=https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks#pipx-recommended>protontricks via python pipx</a> and run the following command:<br>
<code>protontricks 107410 d3dcompiler_43 d3dx10_43 d3dx11_43 mfc140 xact_64</code></p>
<h4 id=52-i-still-have-problems-with-sound>5.2 I still have problems with sound</h4>
<p>You have 2 options to achieve the same fix.<br>
Either you can set the env variable <code>WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xaudio2_7=n"</code> in the Steam startup options (or via the Arma 3 Unix Launcher).
<span class=image>
<img src=/pictures/armalinux/armalaunchoptions-xaudio.png alt>
</span>
<br>
The other way is to set it via <code>protontricks 107410 winecfg</code> and then under &ldquo;Libraries&rdquo;.<br>
<span class=image>

</p>
<h4 id=53-arma-doesnt-open-or-crashes-instantly>5.3 Arma doesnt open or crashes instantly</h4>
<p>Run the following command depending on your linux distro to install possibly missing dependencies<br>
Arch Linux based: <code>sudo pacman -S vulkan-tools</code><br>
Debian/Ubuntu based: <code>sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-utils</code><br>
Fedora: <code>sudo dnf install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools</code></p>
<h4 id=54-command-x-returns-error-y>5.4 Command X returns error Y</h4>
<p>Double check for software and driver updates as well as the spelling of the commands and the settings. If you still got errors continue to Chapter 5.99</p>
<h4 id=599-i-still-have-a-problem>5.99 I still have a problem</h4>

<h3 id=6-increasing-performance>6. Increasing Performance</h3>
<h4 id=61-additional-launch-parameters>6.1 Additional Launch Parameters</h4>
<p>Try a combination of the following to see what works for you the best. Set them as desired via the Arma 3 Unix Launcher or add them to the Steam command line.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-noSplash</code> No splash screens. Very minor game startup speedup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-skipIntro</code> Static Background for main manu. Minor game startup speedup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-world=empty</code> Load an empty world for main menu background. Significant game startup speedup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-exThreads=3</code> for 2 CPU cores or <code>-exThreads=7</code> for 4 cores or more; Offloads some work onto different threads. usually minor FPS Increase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-enableHT</code> enables use of logical cores instead of only physical cores. May improve or harm FPS depending of your PC. Try if it works for you. This is overwritten by <code>-cpuCount</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-hugepages</code> Enable huge page size for memory allocation. Try if it works for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-noLogs</code> Not having to write logs may increase performance, but be sure to disable this if you need to troubleshoot problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-malloc=&lt;string></code> Use a particular Memory Allocator (for advanced users)(More infos <a href=https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_Custom_Memory_Allocator>here</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-cpuCount=1</code> Reportedly solves some issure for some people but might decrease performance by a noticable amount. NOTE: This is fixed on the arma perf brance and will find its way into the release branch of Arma soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
