A example usecase for this would be building AAPS via SSH from your phone if you need a new apk for whatever reason while you have no physical access to your PC.
Note: This Guide is a draft that aims to be integrated into the AAPS Wiki once finished!

Since Proton 4.11 as good as all tweaks needed to run Arma became obsolete, and it became as easy as never before to play not only Arma and Steam Games, but also non-Steam games because of many Proton improvements being up streamed to Wine. You can check if your Games are working on the Lutris Website, the WineHQ and the ProtonDB Websites.</description></item></channel></rss>
